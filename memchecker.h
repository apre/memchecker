 * \brief debug-mode memory allocator.
 *
 * \license WTFPL v2
 * \mainpage
 *
 *  \section intro What is that
 *
 * This module reimplement the c++ new and delete operator
 * to get predictable garbage valies after new and delete.
 *
 * A list of allocated chunks is also maintained, and assert will
 * fire-up if trying to deallocate invalid (ie non allocated) blocks.
 *
 * Also assert fires in case of invalid cross alloc/free (a c++ new followed by a
 * C dfree() call).
 *
 * Allocation and deallocation are thread-safe (internally protected by mutex).
 *
 * Main ideas are taken from the awesome book "writing solid code", and then enhanced
 * to handle both C and C++ allocs.
 *
 * Defining \c DMEMALLOC_IMPLEMENT allow to only include "dmemalloc.h". DO it only once !
 *
 * \section usage Usage
 * The following flags disable this module:
 *    - \c  NDEBUG (in that case, we are in \c RELEASE mode
 * Flags that Enables the module in any cases:
 *    - \c FORCE_DEBUG_MEMORY
 *
